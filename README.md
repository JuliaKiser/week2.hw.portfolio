## Project Description

The goal of this unit was to put your CSS skills to work with a strong emphasis on using flex. It will challenge you!

For my project I really focused on creating something for the future as we gain more skills and to really expand my portfolio. We were given an image to replicate creating multiple sections and content within each section. 

I created 3 sections About, Work, and Contact and then units within each. At the end it should look like the image provided with flex, hover features and make your page responsive. 

Click 'Hire Me' and enter my page!!

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
