Homework Assignment for Unit 2 -Advanced CSS

## Project Description

This assignment provided us with an HTML and CSS file that needed to be refactored. The goal for refactoring this webpage means to clean up the HTML code and to ensure that the webpage was accessible. 

In addition to refactoring, I added comments before various elements within the html document. Overall I found myself removing divs as the entire webpage was full of them. And instead I replaced them with header, footer, section, articles elements instead. This allowed me to keep the webpage look the same, keep all its functions the same but define the areas of the webpage better so that when changes are needed - you will not have to sort through all the divs to find the banner to change.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
